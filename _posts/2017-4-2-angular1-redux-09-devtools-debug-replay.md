...and now it gets really fun. Rewind! Playback!

I installed the [Chrome Redux DevTools extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/redux-devtools/lmhkpmbekcpmknklioeibfkpmmfibljd?utm_source=gmail){:target="_blank"}
and scoured the internet for how to make my Angular app work with with it. 

Looking inside the setup of [app.js](https://gitlab.com/rcotter-onbyone/angular-1-redux-blog/compare/4f6fac1c...6a50e04f){:target="_blank"} 
the third parameter of the store creation
looks for the Chrome extension and sets up a custom monitor I'll explain shortly.
```javascript
angular
  .module('app', [...])
  .config((..., $ngReduxProvider) => {
    $ngReduxProvider.createStoreWith(
      ...,
      ...,
      [
        window.__REDUX_DEVTOOLS_EXTENSION__ ? window.__REDUX_DEVTOOLS_EXTENSION__({
          getMonitor: (monitor) => { DevToolsConfig.devToolsIsPlayingBack = monitor.isMonitorAction; }
        }) : f => f
      ]
    );
  .run(['$ngRedux', '$rootScope', '$timeout', ($ngRedux, $rootScope, $timeout) => {
    //To reflect state changes when disabling/enabling actions via the monitor
    //there is probably a smarter way to achieve that
    $ngRedux.subscribe(() => {
      $timeout(() => {$rootScope.$apply(() => {})}, 100);
    });
  }])
  .component('app', AppComponent);
```
Maybe it is not production ready but I finally got it!

Now just open the `Redux` tab in `Chrome DevTools` and view your state changes as you 
use your app. Even more fun, your state changes get recorded and you can play them 
back!

Your state is being used to drive the app. No button clicks or user actions
are being triggered. ...but ajax will be re-triggered. However, it will be ignored.
It's results will not modify the recorded state. I imagined it would make 
a mess of backend data. Thus, I introduced a couple of discrete workarounds to detect 
when the code is being exercised by state playback and in those case skip over ajax calls.

This is a pretty powerful tool. For a great debugging demo [watch this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xsSnOQynTHs){:target="_blank"}

There are even third party tools that let you capture your user's state, serialize it and play it back locally.
